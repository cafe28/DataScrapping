# DataScrapping

Mars Part 1:
The code aims to extract titles and preview text from a website featuring news about Mars: illustrates a basic web scraping process, utilizing Splinter for automated browsing and BeautifulSoup for HTML parsing. My code demostrates how to extract specific information from a webpage and organize it into Python data structures for further analysis or presentation.

Here's a breakdown of its key steps:
- The script utilizes Chrome to visit the Mars news site. 
- After visiting the site, the script creates a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content of the webpage.
- The code proceeds to extract titles and preview text from the identified text elements.

Mars Part 2:
The code is aimed at scraping and analyzing Mars weather data from a specific website: it demonstrates a comprehensive process of web scraping, data manipulation, analysis, and visualization using Python libraries like BeautifulSoup, Pandas, and Matplotlib.
- The script uses automated browsing to visit a webpage containing Mars temperature data.
- After visiting the website, the code creates a BeautifulSoup object to parse the HTML content and extract data from the table on the page.
- Finally, the DataFrame is exported to a CSV file for further use.
